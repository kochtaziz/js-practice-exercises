1. Square Root Checker
Explanation:
This script prompts the user to enter a number, checks if itâ€™s a positive number, and then displays its square root. If the input is invalid (negative or not a number), it shows an error alert.

2. Alert Execution Demo
Explanation:
Demonstrates the difference between scripts placed in the <head> and <body> sections. It shows alerts from both locations and loads an external JavaScript file.

3. Sum Two Numbers
Explanation:
Prompts the user to input two integers, checks if both inputs are valid numbers, and displays their sum. If invalid, it alerts the user.

4. Find Maximum of Three Numbers
Explanation:
Asks the user for three integers and determines which one is the greatest, then displays the maximum number.

5. Basic Calculator
Explanation:
A simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user, performs the corresponding operation, and displays the result. Includes error checking for invalid inputs and division by zero.

6. Arithmetic Operations
Explanation:
Takes two integers and performs several arithmetic operations on them: subtraction, addition, exponentiation, and modulo. The results are displayed directly on the page.

7. Loops Demo
Explanation:
Demonstrates different types of loops (for, while, and do-while) by printing sequences and squares of numbers. It also displays a sequence separated by **.

8. GCD Calculator
Explanation:
Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers entered by the user using the subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm.

9. Number Guessing Game (4 Attempts)
Explanation:
Generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has up to 4 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program indicates if the guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the user fails, it reveals the number.

10. Number Guessing Game (10 Attempts)
Explanation:
Similar to the previous guessing game but gives the user 10 attempts instead of 4, providing more chances to guess the random number between 1 and 100.
